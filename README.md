# GitHub repositories and users autocomplete component

## Installation

Replace {release_tag} with the version you want to install (eg. "0.0.1").

```bash
npm i https://github.com/JaroslawPokropinski/github-autofill/releases/download/{release_tag}/github-autofill-{release_tag}.tgz
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { GhAutofill } from "github-autofill";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <GhAutofill debounceTime={300} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Requirements

- Donâ€™t use an existing autocomplete library (even if in real life this would be preferred).

- Minimal chars number to initialize search: 3.

- Result items are combined and displayed alphabetically using repository and profile name as ordering keys.

- Number of result items should be limited to 50 per request.

- The component should give visual feedback for when the data is being fetched, the results are empty, or the request resulted in an error.

- The component supports keyboard strokes (up and down arrows to browse the results, enter to open a new tab with the repository/user page).

- The solution should also display a meaningful snippet of your ability to test the code.
